        '"The City of Boulder has historically leveraged its local resources to push policy efforts upwards to effect systemic change." [3]',
        '"Like climate policy and policies that address root causes of homelessness, both rooted in consequences of past policy decisions, the city\'s efforts to address Racial Equity should be part of a broader regional, state and national effort." [3]',
        '"We cannot and should not do this alone. We must work together to accomplish scalable change to rectify a system that, for too long, has continued to cause so much harm." [3]',
        '"During the first half of the 20th century, explicit racism gave way to more implicit forms of racism, legally continuing racial and socio-economic segregation." [3]',
        '"Local policies are and have been more nuanced, but often still lead to similar disparate impacts as those of explicitly discriminatory policies." [3]',
